## User Story
AS a National Park geek,
I want to be able to see a list of National Parks and when I click on each of them,
I want to be able to see useful information about the park, location, visitor center hours and contact number, map and available campground. I would also like to see a wheelchair accessible trails and campground in the park. 
So that they can keep a list of books to purchase.
